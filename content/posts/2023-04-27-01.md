These are the Android apps that I use while traveling.  I put them here so I can easily re-install them.

## Fuel Related

We drive a diesel and use these apps to find fuel.

### GasBuddy

Probably the best-known app on this page, I use GasBuddy when I'm not towing.  There are regions of the country where it doesn't work very well and I don't like the app very much, but I'm buying 30 gallons at a time which makes it worthwhile.

### OpenRoads

RVers can get a diesel fleet card from [OpenRoads](https://myopenroads.com) which brings down the high prices at participating truck stops like Love's or TA/Petro.  The fleet card price is usually about the best price you'll find.  Sometimes it's close to what you see at local stations and sometimes it's a *lot* less.  The card only works at the pumps where the trucks fuel. We have a 33-foot fifth wheel so that's a good thing while we're towing.

### Trucker Path

We like to avoid interstates which makes the big chain truck stops harder to find.  I put my route into Trucker Path and it shows me all of the truck stops along the route.  It's saved my bacon in West Texas and Northwest New Mexico to name two.  The app is messy and it does a lot more than I need, but the free version shows every truck stop on my route.
